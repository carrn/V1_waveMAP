This is code used to recreate figures from Carr et al., 2025

MATLAB and Python code used to construct the figures found in:

High-resolution laminar recordings reveal structure-function relationships in monkey V1
Nicole Carr, Shude Zhu, Kenji Lee, Ruobing Xia, Xiaomo Chen, Alec Perliss, Tirin Moore, Chandramouli Chandrasekaran
bioRxiv 2025.05.14.653875; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.14.653875

Experimental data are located at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.x3ffbg7p2 
Scripts are organized based on the order of figures in the manuscript (tested in Matlab R2021a).
